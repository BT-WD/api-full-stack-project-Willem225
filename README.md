# CZN Deck Builder

A deck builder for **Chaos Zero Nightmare** with a live **Faint Memory** calculator that mirrors the in-game rules, plus local "accounts" for saving decks.

**Live demo:** https://bt-wd.github.io/api-full-stack-project-Willem225/

## Stack

Pure static site — no backend.

- Vanilla JS (ES modules)
- HTML + CSS (dark theme)
- Card catalog loaded from `cards.json`
- Accounts + decks persisted to browser `localStorage`

> ⚠️ Auth is **client-side only**. Passwords live in localStorage in plain text. This is intentional for a static-hosted demo — never do this in production.

## Running locally

It's pure static — any local web server works. Easiest options:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node (without installing anything globally)
npx http-server -p 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000.

Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` **won't work** — the browser blocks ES module imports and `fetch('cards.json')` over `file://`.

## Layout

```
index.html          SPA shell
cards.json          Static card catalog (loaded on startup)
css/style.css       Dark theme

## Data

All app state lives in these `localStorage` keys:

- `czn_users_v1` — registered accounts
- `czn_decks_v1` — decks keyed by user id
- `czn_token` / `czn_user` — active session

Clearing site data resets everything.

## Hosting

Deployed via **GitHub Pages** from `main` / root. Pushes to `main` auto-rebuild within ~1 minute.
